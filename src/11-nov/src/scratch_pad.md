Design
- 1. `development` or `finding model experimentally and training model`:
  - (standard) model baseline architecture
  - (standard) model training loop & monitoring curves & mis-classified. (training & validationd dataset)
  - (standard) trained model or parameters upload on github & huggingface
  - later
    - model experimenting (parametric)
- 2. `solution` or `trained model & model architecture`
  - (standard) evaluate model on test dataset
  - (standard) model weakness & strength analysis. (mis classfied with confidence, correctly classified with low confidence)
