## Problem: Digit Recognizer
Problem
- Learn to Identify Digit in 28 pixels Height * 28 pixels Width Image. 10 Digits
- Type of Problem: Easy for Humans but Hard for Computers
- This is easy problem but Proxy for other more complicated & useful problems

Why This Problem?
1. Entry into Domain of Vision & Intelligence. All other complex problems are solved by building on approach on this simple Problem
2. First Benchmark Dataset. Benchmark Datasets are important because everything is tested on them. Hence need to master these

Evaluation Metric: Accuracy
If 97% accuracy = 97% images correctly classified & 3% incorrectly classified
